<h2 class="source_category_title">How GFW-Commodities Works</h2><div class="source_body"><p class="source_category_description">“The loss of natural capital due to land use for primary production and processing activities is estimated to cost the global economy $1.8 trillion annually.” -<a href="https://www.cdp.net/CDPResults/CDP-global-forests-report-2013.pdf" target="_blank">CDP. The Commodity Crunch: Value at risk from deforestation</a></p><p>Almost every business depends on forests in some way. Buyers of commodities face risks if they do not know how their supply chain impacts forest resources. Sellers of commodities risk losing customers if they can’t credibly demonstrate that their products are deforestation-free.</p><p>Global Forest Watch-Commodities provides information and analysis to help you avoid these risks and be a better steward of forests.</p><p>The GFW-Commodities site is now open for beta testing to companies and individuals around the world who want to see how commodity supply chains are affecting forests in near real-time. Building on the flagship Global Forest Watch platform, we are now developing and launching specialized features and services geared for business users. This platform enables business users to:</p><ol><li>Use data on forest change, concessions, mills, and more to assess supply chain risks</li><li>Verify that your commodity suppliers are in compliance with deforestation-free sourcing policies</li><li>Identify issues as they happen</li><li>Evaluate and demonstrate compliance with sustainability certification standards</li><li>Communicate with customers about deforestation-free commodity production</li></ol><p>Over the coming years, GFW-Commodities will develop these features together with a core group of corporate road-testers committed to supply chain transparency and ending commodity-driven deforestation. We’ll also establish a working group of interested companies to test the site as it is developed and provide feedback.</p><p>For more information or to join the conversation, contact Elizabeth Baer, Corporate Engagement Manager for Global Forest Watch at GFWbusiness@wri.org.</p><p></p><p>You can download a copy of GFW’s corporate partnerships policy here (coming soon).</p><p></p></div>
