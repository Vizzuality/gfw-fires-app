<h2 class="source_category_title">History</h2><p class="source_category_description"></p><div class="source_body"><p>Global Forest Watch originally began in 1997 as an initiative to establish a global forest monitoring network around the world, convened by the World Resources Institute and partners. It began as part of WRI’s Forest Frontiers Initiative. The original GFW achieved many outcomes toward the conservation of large intact forest areas.</p><p>WRI has continued the work that Global Forest Watch started, working to improve forest information by merging the latest technology with on-the-ground partnerships. This culminated in the 2014 launch of the flagship Global Forest Watch platform. Now, GFW-Commodities offers a specialized portal to meet the specific needs of businesses.</p><p>GFW Commodities is also built on the foundations of the Forest and Landscapes in Indonesia project, which works to support government and civil society actions for effective and equitable land use in Indonesia. With GFW-Commodities, we bring our experience and expertise engaging companies and governments in the palm oil sector together with Global Forest Watch’s ability to leverage the advent of new technologies and increased global connectivity.</p></div>
