<h2 class=source_category_title>Forest fires and their impact</h2><div class=source_body><p>Fires are a long-standing problem. The causes of these fires are complex, and are often attributed to companies clearing land for oil palm or other plantations, small farmers clearing land for cultivation, or communities using fire to clear forest, often in areas of conflict with large companies.</p><p>In low-lying primary forests such as those in Indonesia, the peat soils can make fires much worse. Peat fires are much harder to put out and release far greater amounts of smoke and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than fires in non-peat areas and are associated with an <a href=http://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/august2011/wildfire.htm target=_blank>increased risk</a> of respiratory illness and heart attacks. This noxious haze can cross oceans and borders, carrying serious pollution and health concerns across the region causing international tensions.</p><p>Help combat forest fires by participating with the GFW Fires system, signing up to receive Fire Alerts in Indonesia, or sharing your story on our blog.</p><p><a href="app/images/Infographic WRI Forest v1.0.pdf" target=_blank>INDONESIAN FOREST FIRES: FROM CAUSE TO EFFECT</a><br><br><img src="app/images/Infographic WRI Forest v1.0_Page_1.png" alt="infograp image page 1" width=95%> <img src="app/images/Infographic WRI Forest v1.0_Page_2.png" alt="infograp image page 2" width=95%></p></div>
