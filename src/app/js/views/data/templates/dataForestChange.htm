              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height. “Tree cover” is the biophysical presence of trees and may take the form of natural forests or plantations existing over a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree canopy cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation.</p>

              <p>When zoomed out, it appears that all tree cover loss occurs in 2001, but in reality loss happened gradually over the study period. As you zoom out, adjacent pixels representing loss—which may have occurred in different years—must be combined into a single pixel to remain visible on a larger scale. Authors of the study decided to display these “aggregate pixels” according to the year loss first occurred in any of the constituent pixels (often 2001 for low zoom levels with very large aggregate pixels). Zoom in for greater detail of when and where loss has occurred for individual 30 × 30 meter pixels.</p>

            <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>This data set measures areas of tree cover loss and tree cover gain across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at 30 × 30 meter resolution. Loss is presented annually (2000 through 2012), while gain is displayed as a 12-year cumulative layer. Loss and gain are displayed differently due to the underlying dynamics of tree cover loss (rapid) versus tree cover gain (slow).</p>

          <p>The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php' target='_blank'>Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a> sensor. Over 600,000 Landsat 7 images were compiled and analyzed using Google Earth Engine, a cloud platform for earth observation and data analysis. The clear land surface observations (30 × 30 meter pixels) in the satellite images were assembled chronologically and a supervised learning algorithm was then applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss or gain.</p>

          <p>Tree cover loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may indicate a number of potential activities, such as timber harvesting, fires or disease, the conversion of natural forest to other land uses, or the crop rotations cycle of tree plantations. Tree cover gain was defined as the inverse of loss, or the establishment of tree canopy in an area that previously had no tree cover.</p>

              <p>The GFW team has clipped out some data in regions where data quality is suspected to be low because of persistent cloud cover over identified ecoregions. This covers parts of Liberia, Venezuela, Guyana, Vietnam, Laos, and Burma/Myanmar. The current extent of the FORMA alerts is available for viewing here—<a href='http://wri-01.cartodb.com/viz/3cc0f4c2-56d3-11e3-80bb-c8600054c0d1/embed_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=false&cartodb_logo=false&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=3&center_lat=-1.845383988573187&center_lon=16.34765625' target='_blank'>FORMA geographic extent</a>.</p>

              <p>The <a href='https://github.com/wri/forma-clj' target='_blank'>algorithm</a> behind the FORMA alerts is constantly evolving to fix bugs and improve accuracy. As a result, what appears on the site and the results of analyses conducted on the site may change over time. It is important to always include the access date when citing FORMA. Analysis of FORMA alerts on the map should be considered definitive, as analysis is based on raw FORMA data, whereas the data on the map are optimized for visual display.

              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as areas with greater than 25% canopy cover (as determined by the <a href='http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1087-3562(2003)007%3C0001%3AGPTCAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2' target='_blank'>Vegetation Continuous Fields data set</a>), and change was measured without regard to forest land use.

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>FORMA is a near real-time tree cover loss alert system. It uses a cloud computing <a href="https://github.com/reddmetrics/forma-clj" target="_blank">algorithm</a> to analyze frequently updated satellite imagery along with complementary information on factors that affect tree cover loss, such as fires and precipitation. The system generates twice-monthly “alerts” for the world’s <a href="http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf" target="_blank">humid tropical forests</a> that identify 500 × 500 meter areas where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred.</p>

          <p>FORMA is designed for quick identification of new areas of tree cover loss. The system analyzes data gathered daily by the <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> sensor, which operates on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>, a measure of vegetation greenness. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are likely to indicate forest being cleared, burned, or defoliated.</p>

          <p>FORMA alerts only appear in areas where the probability of tree cover loss is greater than or equal to 50%.</p>

          <p>Upcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 × 250 meters, and expanding coverage to tropical dry forest and eventually to other biomes across the global scale.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Methodology</h3>
          <p>This data set uses freely available satellite imagery, collected by the <a href='http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/' target='_blank'>Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a>, which operates on NASA's Terra and Aqua (EOS PM) satellite platforms and views the entire Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. The images help to reveal notable changes in vegetation cover over time using an indicator that measures vegetation intensity called the <a href='http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php' target='_blank'>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>. By applying an automated algorithm to this input and in combination with complementary data inputs for fire hotspots and global precipitation averages, areas where tree cover loss is likely to have occurred are therefore identified. The algorithm also employs parallel processing in a remote server system the cloud that enables the rapid analysis of these very large data sets.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Explanation</h3>
          <p>Tree cover loss alerts appear when and where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred after 2005. Thus the alerts should not be interpreted as an analysis of total tree cover loss area but rather as an indication of an area that has a high probability of having experienced tree cover loss or disturbance over time. The system employs advanced statistical techniques to achieve the best fit to scientifically validate information on loss, measured as a probability. On the GFW website, alerts appear only for areas where there is a 50% or higher probability of tree cover loss. That is, alerts appear for a particular period when there has been significant loss in the area during or before that period.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Temporal and spatial resolution</h3>
          <p>FORMA alerts are displayed on the GFW site as monthly data, and the site is updated each month. Users who download data for analysis will find that the underlying data set is actually available at 16-day intervals, intervals that do not line up perfectly with calendar months. Data is displayed at a monthly resolution on GFW due to the monthly availability of precipitation data input. Users can manipulate the GFW time slider to view trends in loss alerts from December 2005 to present.</p>

          <p>The alert system currently identifies 500 × 500 meter areas where loss is statistically likely to have occurred. Alerts for a 250-meter resolution version are currently being developed on Google’s Earth Engine platform and will be available in 2014.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Geographic extent</h3>
          <p>FORMA alerts are currently available only for humid tropical forests (as defined by <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9439.full#ref-1' target='_blank'>Hansen et al. (2008)</a>, based on <a href='http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf' target='_blank'>WWF’s terrestrial ecoregions</a>) spanning portions of 89 countries. The development team is working to incorporate additional data to extend the geographic coverage beyond the current extent. To visualize the geographic extent of the alerts on the map, switch on the “Humid Tropical Forest Biome” layer.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Data applications</h3>
          <p>The alerts have been designed for quick identification of tree cover loss as it happens. This allows for rapid response and prioritization of scarce financial and human resources dedicated to forest conservation or sustainable forest management. Armed with this information, stakeholders can use preemptive methods such as on-the-ground visits or aerial inspection with high-resolution satellite imagery (less than 5-meter pixel resolution) to investigate suspected tree cover loss areas.</p>

          <p>In addition, the alerts may be of value to a variety of researchers who study both temporal and spatial patterns related to tree cover loss areas.</p>

          <p>Using the GFW platform, the alerts can be compared against other relevant data layers, such as protected areas and concessions boundaries, to evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices across time and spatial extent.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Accuracy and validation</h3>
          <p>Inaccuracies are an inherent part of remote sensing analysis. FORMA alerts appear in areas with a greater than 50% probability of tree cover loss, based on the algorithm described under Methodology. However, persistent cloud cover is a continuous issue in the tropics, and extreme flooding can also produce unreliable remotely sensed data that will result in tree cover loss “false positives” (alerts where no actual tree cover loss has occurred). Furthermore, the alerting system cannot detect all forest cover loss, whether due to the small size of the loss area, persistent cloud cover, or other explanations still being identified through GFW validation efforts.</p>

          <p>The major instances of false positives may occur as the following:</p>

          <ol class='bullets'>
            <li><strong>A random, "speckled" distribution of alerts across an ecoregion, or complete filling of a small ecoregion.</strong> Caused by limited or sparse training data, particularly in small ecoregions, which makes it difficult to tune the model there. As a result, alerts cannot be reliably detected. In a normal ecoregion, alerts are usually clustered.</li>

            <li><strong>A rapid explosion of alerts over 1-3 months covering a relatively large area.</strong> Caused by a significant, persistent drop in detected vegetation levels due to persistent cloud cover along coastlines, in mountains, or elsewhere.</li>

            <li><strong>Alerts in water.</strong> Caused by shifting water bodies. These alerts should be considered not necessarily as false positives but rather as ambiguous alerts requiring additional data for corroboration.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The GFW team is working aggressively to address potential inaccuracies in the data through rigorous validation methods. Specifically, the GFW team is comparing the growing data set of historical alerts to other validated data sets, which are being used for similar applications.</p>

          <p><a href='http://www.wri.org/publication/satellite-based-forest-clearing-detection-brazilian-amazon' target='_blank'>This issue brief</a> demonstrates the spatial correlation of the alerts with the PRODES and DETER data sets, produced by the Brazilian Space Agency for the Amazon. The conclusions from the working paper help to illustrate the potential pitfalls of the algorithm, along with its strengths. Through future refinement and proposed crowdsourcing efforts, the GFW team expects the data quality of the FORMA Alerts will continue to improve.</p>

          <p>The Deforestation Alert System (Sistema de Alerta de Desmatamento—SAD) is a monthly alert that monitors forest cover loss and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon. The system generates information that is published monthly by <a href='http://www.imazon.org.br/' target='_blank'>Imazon</a>, a Brazilian NGO, through its <em>Forest Transparency Bulletin</em>. The monthly alerts are derived from a temporal mosaic of <a href='http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/' target='_blank'>MODIS</a> daily images that are scaled down from 500 × 500 meter to 250 × 250 meter resolution. The monthly results are then validated using medium resolution images from the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (<a href='http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/' target='_blank'>CBERS</a>) and NASA <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/' target='_blank'>Landsat</a> data in order to “ground-truth” the results being reported.</p>

          <p>The <a href='http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/latest.html' target='_blank'>Quarterly Indicator of Cover Change (QUICC)</a> product was developed at the NASA Ames Research Center by the <a href='http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/' target='_blank'>CASA</a> ecosystem modeling team. QUICC compares the MODIS global vegetation index (VI) images at the exact same time period each year on a quarterly basis (end of March, June, September, and December) and identifies land areas that have lost at least 40% of their green vegetation from the previous product and over the past year. This level of green vegetation loss is commonly associated with major forest or tree cover loss.</p>

          <p>The CASA team updates the global QUICC products as soon as the newest quarterly MODIS worldwide VI image is produced. After September (Q3) 2012, the data were adjusted to exclude forest areas located >37 degrees north as a result of confusion caused by year-to-year variations in seasonal snow cover.</p>

              <p>Not all fires are detected. There are several reasons why MODIS may not have detected a certain fire. The fire may have started and ended between satellite overpasses. The fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected in the (approximately) 1 km<sup>2</sup> pixel. Cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire.</p>
              <p>It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues.</p>

          <p>The Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) delivers global MODIS-derived hotspots and fire locations. The active fire locations represent the center of a 1-kilometer pixel that is flagged by the MOD14/MYD14 Fire and Thermal Anomalies Algorithm as containing one or more fires within the pixel.</p>

          <p>The near real-time active fire locations are processed by the <a href='https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data' target='_blank'>NASA Land and Atmosphere Near Real-Time Capability for EOS (LANCE)</a> using the standard MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies product (MOD14/MYD14). Data older than the past 7 days can be obtained from the <a href='https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/firms/active-fire-data#tab-content-6' target='_blank'>Archive Download Tool</a>. The tool provides near real-time data and, as it becomes available and is replaced with the standard NASA (MCD14ML) fire product.</p>

          <p>More information on active fire data is available from the <a href='https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/firms' target='_blank'>NASA FIRMS website</a>.</p>
